# CRM Sales

The goal of this project was to analyze B2B sales pipeline data from a company that sells computer hardware. The data provided included information on accounts, products, and sales team outcomes. The company wants to know how each sales team is performing, total profits per team, peak profits based on month and quarter, and which products bring in the most profit.
